# Room-Video-XML-Editor
Python application to edit xml files used as configuration files for Crestron distributed video systems.

The roomAVDistribution.xml file is loaded to the NVRAM folder of a Crestron processor and read by the A/V program to dynamically configure common features of A/V systems such as - describing which video sources are available in a room, adding a TV lift to a room or configuring a local A/V receiver in a room. This program provides a graphical interface to edit the xml file which is helpful for several reasons. First, it describes what each of the elements and attributes of xml file do, making editing more intuitive than making changes in notepad++. Second, it dramatically reduces the chance of common mistakes made while editing such as forgetting to close a tag or missing a quotation.
